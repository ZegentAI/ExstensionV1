<p align="center">
  <strong>🎉 We're Going Open Source! 🎉</strong>
</p>

<p align="center">
  We're excited to announce that Zegent is transitioning to open source! Join us in building the future of AI-powered crypto analysis.

## 🌟 Why Open Source?

We believe that the best tools for Web3 should be built in the open, by the community. Starting with our V1 extension codebase, we'll be progressively open-sourcing more components of our tools to enable community-driven development and innovation.
