# Contributing to Zegent

We love your input! We want to make contributing to Zegent as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Current Focus: Agent Prompts
Our main development focus is currently on improving and expanding our AI agent prompts. We especially welcome contributions that enhance our trading, research, contract analysis and social sentiment agent capabilities.

## Contributor Incentives
Zegent uses a DAO-controlled ecosystem wallet to incentivize valuable contributions to the project. Contributors may receive token rewards based on the impact and quality of their contributions. Details about the reward structure will be announced as the DAO governance system matures.

## We Develop with Github
We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issue tracker](https://github.com/ZegentAI/zegent/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/ZegentAI/zegent/issues/new); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## License
